# Earth Resilience Dashboard

**AI + NASA Earth Data → Building Climate-Smart, Resilient Cities for People & Planet**

Earth Resilience Dashboard is an AI + NASA-data-powered platform that helps urban planners and citizens design climate-smart, resilient cities through dashboards, simulations, gamification, and community action.

## 🌍 Features

- **NASA-informed dashboards** - Real-time air quality, water, land use, urban growth analysis using MODIS, Landsat, GHSL data
- **AI climate & planning assistant** - Personalized recommendations for citizens, planners, and government officials
- **Gamified eco-actions + badges** - Earn XP, EcoCoins, and unlock achievements for climate actions
- **Simulation studio with digital twin cities** - Test climate interventions before implementation
- **Global impact map + community challenges** - Connect with climate champions worldwide
- **Marketplace + admin tools** - Redeem rewards and manage platform content

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd earth-resilience-dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app runs in mock mode by default with sample NASA/GHSL/WRI data.
